# Machine Failure Classification: Predictive Maintenance Solution  

## Project Overview  
This project is focused on building a predictive maintenance solution that uses machine learning to classify machine failure types. The goal is to enable proactive maintenance by predicting machine breakdowns, helping companies avoid costly downtime and extend the lifespan of their equipment.

The solution is developed using a Random Forest model, trained and evaluated using real-world machine failure data. The project uses data preprocessing techniques to handle missing values, remove irrelevant features, and engineer features that improve model performance. The final model achieves high accuracy in predicting machine failures, demonstrating the potential for reducing operational costs through data-driven insights.

## Methodology

1. **Data Importing**  
   The project starts by importing the dataset from its source (e.g., CSV file) into the analysis tool (RapidMiner or Python).

2. **Data Cleaning**  
   After importing, the data undergoes cleaning to handle missing values, remove duplicates, and eliminate inconsistencies, ensuring high-quality input for model training.

3. **Data Analysis**  
   Conducting Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand data distribution, feature relationships, and patterns. This includes correlation analysis and visualizations to select the best features for model building.

4. **Data Processing**  
   Further data transformations, such as converting categorical variables into numerical representations and scaling the data to manage imbalances between failure and non-failure records.

5. **Model Selection and Training**  
   A Random Forest model is selected due to its robustness and ability to handle imbalanced datasets. The data is split into a training set (70%) and testing set (30%), and the model is trained on the training data.

6. **Model Evaluation**  
   The model is evaluated on the testing set using performance metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. A confusion matrix is plotted to visualize the model's ability to classify different failure types.

7. **Result Analysis**  
   The model achieved a high accuracy rate of 99.30%, showcasing its reliability in predicting machine failures. This demonstrates the effectiveness of the predictive maintenance solution.
